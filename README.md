# Site Portolio

## Background

I've been with Jobvite's Career Website (CWS) team for 5 years, and spent the past ~3 years working as a UI Developer for their Brand packages.

## The CWS Brand Packages
Every customer who purchases Jobvite HIRE (our applicant tracking system...the bread-and-butter of Jobvite's offerings) receives a standard, static career page (if you're going to post jobs and attract applicants, you need a page where you can display the links for those jobs).

Our standard career sites are...well...standard (white background; left column: job title; right column: job location (etc.)).  Customers can upgrade to purchase one of our "Brand" packages.

With a Brand package, we create a "skin" (we mimic the customer's fonts, colors, spacing, etc.), and we also add features that customers cannot get with a standard site (search-filters, featured jobs, image-carousels, videos, testimonials, interactive maps, and so on).  

## So what I am I viewing here?

If you visit (), you'll see rows and rows of tiles.  Each tile is a preview into a site I worked on.  Just click on any tile to visit the site and see my work.


### Some notes

Over the years, some customers have discontinued their Brand packages, or upgraded them.  In either case: I can't just hyperlink you to the customer's site because it doesn't contain my work anymore.  Some of these tiles will point you to web-archive pages, which preserve the work I did.  Just a head's up.
